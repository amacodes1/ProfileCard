        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Mercy Ezihe, a Frontend Developer who loves turning ideas
          into beautiful, interactive digital experiences. I care deeply about
          clean design, smooth user interactions, and writing code that feels as
          elegant as it looks. Building for the web lets me blend creativity and
          logic and that balance is what keeps me hooked every day.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I sometimes hesitate when tackling complex backend integrations or
          advanced animation logic. But I’m learning to embrace challenges,
          debug systematically, and grow through consistent practice.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Keep learning, stay humble, and never lose your curiosity. Remember
          that growth takes time, but every project adds another layer to your
          confidence and skill set.

      <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that great frontend development blends art and logic, design
          that feels natural, supported by code that’s efficient and
          maintainable. My mission is to master both sides of that balance.
